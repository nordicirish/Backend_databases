Explain what is special about the database user root. Why root user should always have a strong password?
Why remote login should always be disabled for root user?
Explain how to disable remote login from root user.

The root account is a superuser account that has all the privileges possible in a database. 
They can add, modify, delete or copy anything in a database. 
Therefore it's most important to restrict access to the root account and protect it with a really strong password to prevent 
a hacker accessing the account and getting unlimited access to the data. It's also best practice to only use the root role for 
developing or maintaining a database but not to allow applications that access the database to have root access so remote login 
for the root user should always be disabled.

To disable remote root access run:

DELETE FROM mysql.user WHERE User='root' AND Host NOT IN ('localhost', '127.0.0.1', '::1');
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
