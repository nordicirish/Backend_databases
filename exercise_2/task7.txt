Explain the difference bitween INNER JOIN, LEFT (OUTER) JOIN and RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN.
A JOIN is to produce a results table which combines rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them. 
In this example Table A and Table B.

An INNER JOIN selects rows which have matching values in both tables and only returns a row as long as there is a match in both Table A and Table B. 
If for example a Table A cell has a value and the corresponding Table B cell has a null value then the row will not be returned.

LEFT (OUTER) JOIN returns all records from the left table (Table A) and the matching records from the right table (Table B). 
Values which don’t have matching counterpart in Table B will be NULL. 

RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN returns all records from the right table (Table B)and the matching records from the right table (Table A). 
Values which don’t have matching counterpart in Table A will be NULL.
